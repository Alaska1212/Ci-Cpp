Clever cats chase curious creatures.
Dogs dig deep down in dark ditches.
Apples and apricots are awesome fruits.
Charlie chose chocolate chips.
Bright blue birds bellow beautifully.
Cheese, cherries, and chocolate are cherished.
Cars can climb cliffs with caution.
But only certain courageous creatures can conquer challenges.
